# hotel-booking
Using Webscraping to get and compare hotels across popular hotel booking sites.

Given a destination, check-in date, and check-out date, we want to be able to get the best deal on the accomodation when going for a trip. It would be better if we had a process to compare the accomodation deals offered by the different websites.

* BeautifulSoup
* Selenium
